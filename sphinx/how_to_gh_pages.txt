# I followed this tutorial: http://daler.github.io/sphinxdoc-test/includeme.html

# set up gh_pages with sphinx
mkdir sphinx
cd sphinx
# set up sphinx in this folder (see how_to_sphinx.txt)

cd ..
mkdir docs
cd docs

# clone the repo (that is in ../) but call it html
git clone http....repo html 

cd html

# make a new branch called gh-pages
git branch gh-pages

git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages
rm .git/index
git clean -fdx

# now html is empty (you killed everything in this repo)

# check it the branch is gh-pages
git branch

# modify sphinx Makefile
cd ../sphinx
# open Makefile and change BUILDDIR to
BUILDDIR      = ../docs

# now build the html
make html

# commit Makefile changes
cd ..
# check the branch, it should be master
git branch
git commit -a -m "modified Makefile"
git push origin master

# and now commit the html
cd docs/html
git branch # should give gh-pages
git add .
git commit -a -m "rebuilt doc"
git push origin gh-pages

# done

# workflow
# update your dir normally and commit to master
# whenever needed rebuild doc and commit

# in sphinx
make html

# in docs/html
git add .
git commit -a -m "rebuilt doc"
git push origin gh-pages
